    <p>
      "Dear Daddy, Happy birthday! I wanted to take a moment to let you know
      just how much you mean to me. You are not only incredibly smart, but you
      also have this special divine protection that makes me feel safe and
      secure whenever I'm with you. Your intelligence has always amazed me, and
      I look up to you as my role model. You inspire me to work hard, think
      critically, and never stop learning. Your wisdom and guidance have shaped
      me into the person I am today. But it's not just your intelligence that
      makes you so special to me. You have a heart of gold and a giving spirit.
      Your cheerful and generous nature always brightens my day. Whether it's
      through your kind words, thoughtful gestures, or selfless acts of
      kindness, you constantly remind me of the importance of spreading love and
      positivity. Dad, I am so grateful to have you in my life. You have been
      there for me through thick and thin, offering unwavering support and
      unconditional love. I cherish the moments we share and the memories we
      create together. On your special day, I want to express my deepest love
      and appreciation for everything you do. Thank you for being the amazing
      father that you are. I hope this year brings you joy, happiness, and all
      the blessings you deserve. Happy birthday, Dad! I love you more than words
      can express. With all my love, [your daughters]"
